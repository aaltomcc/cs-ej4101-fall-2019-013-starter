# Hello website

welcome to the CS-E4101 introduction to DevOps course!

## About my course

I actually completed a course known as software engineering. The course was given in Aalto. That course has educated me to different software development processes and methods in wish devop happens to be part of them. This is the reason why I took this course is because I have always wanted to know how the delivery of software operates technically, and also how it facilitate for better products. I am also very interested in understanding how devop is contributing to software development, why is it important to add devop to software testing and control of codes that are produced by developers
